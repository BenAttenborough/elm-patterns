This guide documents patterns that are commonly used in Elm applications. We try to avoid uncommon or esoteric patterns.

The pattern explanation needs to be as simple as possible. We don't want to write a whole essay for each one. They should be easy to read and understand in a few minutes (whenever possible).

The pattern explanation doesn't need to be thorough (i.e. show all the code). As long at it conveys the idea and benefits and links to a more detailed source.

These patterns should try to align with the community recommendations and best practices.

Patterns are written in first person voice using the pronoun "we". E.g. "We might choose to use X".
